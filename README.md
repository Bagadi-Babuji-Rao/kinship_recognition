# kinship_recognition
-> Business problem Description
1. Blood relatives often share facial features. Now researchers at Northeastern University want to improve their algorithm for facial image classification to bridge the gap between research and other familial markers like DNA results.
2. An automatic kinship classifier has been in the works at Northeastern since 2010. Yet this technology remains largely unseen in practice for a couple of reasons:

   2.1 Existing image databases for kinship recognition tasks aren't large enough to capture and reflect the true data distributions of the families of the world.
   2.2 Many hidden factors affect familial facial relationships, so a more discriminant model is needed than the computer vision algorithms used most often for higher-      level categorizations (e.g. facial recognition or object classification).
   2.3 In 2019, North Eastern Lab conducted a competition on kaggle to get help from outside world to build a more complex model by determining if two people are blood-    related based solely on images of their faces.

-> Problem statement: Predict whether two persons share kinship between them based solely on their facial images

-> Source of the dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/c/recognizing-faces-in-the-wild/data .

-> Data provided by the NELab contains train data, test data , relationships. Train data contains pictures of people's faces along with their family and member ids.While test data simply contains pictures of random people.
